Linear correlation scores are typically a value between -1, 1 with 0 represnting no relationship, for feature selection scores are made positive and we are often intrested in a positive score with the largeer the
positive  value, the larger relationship and more likely the feature should be selcted for modeling , as such the linear correlation can be made converted into a correlation statistic with only positive value,
we use f_regression() function  via the SelectKBest classand in the final we use A bar chart the feature importance scores for each input feature is created , The plot clearly shows 8 to 10 features are a lot
more importantthan the other features.
